# EL-Basics-of-Programming
This course covers basics of programming skills.
Course outline for initial few classes.

## 1. Variables and data types.
Why and when do we need them. What kind of variables and their representation. Why overflow and underflow, infinity etc. Basics of int, float and string.

## 2.* Debugging the code.
How not to use print (or equivalent for debugging). Working with conditional execution.

## 3. Working with loops and basic function/procedures.*

## 4. Using recursion to solve simple problems*
Design thinking in terms of recursion rather than computation to solve.

## 5. Understanding arrays.
Using arrays and recursion.

## 6. Applying recursion concept to solve different type of problems.*

Others to be worked out. We can look into object oriented programming and classes, variable length entities, Inheritance, polymorphism, operator overloading etc.

## Pre-requisite:
### 1.Students should have laptop access with full charge to last for 1.5hrs.
### 2.  Missing classes.
If any student misses two consecutive classes, it would be considered as withdrawal and will not be permitted to attend subsequent classes.
### 3. Missing Assignments.
Students need to complete the assignment (programming given) before coming to next class. Two such non-completion will lead to withdrawal.
