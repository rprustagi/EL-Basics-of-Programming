# MT-Python-Programming
This course was done during covid-19 lockdown at Mantri Tranquil primarily targeted towards 11th and 12th class students.
These online classes are conducted to create interest among students to learn python by writing simple and small program to understand the concept as well as bring confidence with some sense of achievement.

## MT-Python-Programming/MT-Programs
The sample programs used during the online class are provided here as well as programming solutions to exercises in each class is also provided. It is recommended that learners should first try to write their own programs before looking at these solutions.

# EL-Basics-of-Programming
This course covers basics of programming skills.
Course outline for initial few classes.

## 1. Variables and data types.
Why and when do we need them. What kind of variables and their representation. Why overflow and underflow, infinity etc. Basics of int, float and string.

## 2.* Debugging the code.
How not to use print (or equivalent for debugging). Working with conditional execution.

## 3. Working with loops and basic function/procedures.

## 4. Using recursion to solve simple problems
Design thinking in terms of recursion rather than computation to solve.

## 5. Understanding arrays.
Using arrays and recursion.

## 6. Applying recursion concept to solve different type of problems.

Others to be worked out. We can look into object oriented programming and classes, variable length entities, Inheritance, polymorphism, operator overloading etc.

## Pre-requisite:
### 1.Students should have laptop access with full charge to last for 1.5hrs.
### 2.  Missing classes.
If any student misses two consecutive classes, it would be considered as withdrawal and will not be permitted to attend subsequent classes.
### 3. Missing Assignments.
Students need to complete the assignment (programming given) before coming to next class. Two such non-completion will lead to withdrawal.
